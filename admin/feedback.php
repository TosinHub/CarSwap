to me 
Dear Ocean Digits Limited,

Thanks for your excellent job so far. I like the skills showcased in this job.

Here are a few observations that need correction or your attention. Please carefully go through all and note them.

1. The social media links should open in separate windows instead of closing the main website.
2. Form header that says (What I have). Please let it be (Car I have). We do nothing else but cars.
3. ACCIDENTS should be ACCIDENT.
                 PAGE 2
1. Form header repeats (What i have) Replace with (What I Want)
2. WHAT CAR DO YOU WANT TO SWAP WITH? replace with THE CAR I WANT?

                 PAGE3.
DIFFERENCE IN CASH: Please change it to change it to 
DIFERENCE ESTIMATED MONEY TO PAY FOR YOUR NEW CAR IS ₦
                 OR 
              (Downgrade)

Note: This is not final price until final evaluation. Thanks for choosing CarSwap.Ng

Book inspection sends only this (Your car Inspection date is:'2017-12-30' at '')
(No Location) It should send complete transaction details (Car details, location and time.)

Please use Tawk.to for website live support. Please Change mycar@carswap.ng to support@carswap.ng

Website Signature should simply be:

CarSwap.Ng is Incoperated and Trading as CarSawp Limited and TradeMarked. Please no Developed By OceanDigits Ltd. But you can include us your portfolio.
We are protecting our indepedence as a tech company due to investors. Investors will not us serious if we are not tech dependent.
